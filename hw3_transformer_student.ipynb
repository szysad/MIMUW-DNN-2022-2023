        "# Task overview\n",
        "In this homework assignment, you will implement a simple Transformer architecture using only basic layers such as nn.Embedding, nn.Linear, ReLU, softmax, and einsum. This will be a decoder-only model (language model), trained on a toy problem. You will analyze the results of the baseline Transformer and results with some minor changes to its components.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Dataset\n",
        "The dataset has already been generated for you. It is an artificial and simple dataset that was designed to make training quick and debugging easy. Each example in the dataset consists of a sequence of tokens, with each token represented by a number from 0 to 9. The length of each sequence is 64 tokens. Each and every sequence starts with token 0 (zero).\n",
        "\n",
        "This is a language modeling task, which means that your model's task is to predict the next token in the sequence. Specifically, for each prefix of the input sequence, your model will generate a prediction for the token that should follow.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset was generated in a particular way, but you don't need to know the details in order to complete the homework assignment. These details are provided in the code that generates the dataset. However, as an overview, we can see some patterns emerging in the following example sequences:\n",
        "\n",
        "* [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 7, 8, 6, 7, 8, 6, 9, 4, ...]\n",
        "  * In this example, 0 seems to always be followed by 1.\n",
        "* [0, 4, 9, 7, 8, 9, 0, 4, 5, 2, 8, 5, 2, 8, 5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 8, 9, 0, 4, ...]\n",
        "  * Here, however, 0 is followed by 4.\n",
        "* [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 4, 7, 8, 0, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 7, 8, 0, 1, 6, 9, 2, 5, ...]\n",
        "  * In every example we can see that the number N is often followed by N+1.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Each example is constructed with random patterns. In order to accurately predict the next token, your model will need to learn these patterns \"on the fly\" as it processes each example. This is called \"in-context learning,\" where the model learns how to figure out the pattern instead of learning the pattern during training.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Model implementation (60% points)\n",
        "For this homework assignment, you will be implementing a version of the Transformer architecture with only the decoder, also known as a language model. Models from GPT family, like ChatGPT, are similar to what you will be implementing. In fact, ChatGPT even helped improve the readability and quality of writing in this homework assignment. A Transformer is helping to teach Transformers!\n",
        "\n",
        "You can read the original paper introducing the Transformer for more details: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your model will consist of the following components:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Learnable, randomly initialized embeddings (using nn.Embedding)\n",
        "* Positional encoding\n",
        "* A number of decoding blocks, each consisting of:\n",
        "  * Multi-head attention (wrapped in a residual connection)\n",
        "  * Feed-forward layer (wrapped in a residual connection)\n",
        "* A linear layer to get the output probabilities\n",
        "\n",
        "The general structure is already provided in the code. You will need to implement the following classes and functions:\n",
        "\n",
        "* get_positional_encoding\n",
        "* Attention\n",
        "* FeedForward\n",
        "* DecoderBlock\n",
        "\n",
        "The DecoderModel has already been implemented, but you are welcome to change it if necessary for visualizations, etc. In general, you are free to change any part of the provided code if it makes it easier for you to implement something. \n",
        "\n",
        "# Model training (10% points)\n",
        "The training loop has already been implemented, and it is up to you to decide on the model and learning parameters to use. The default values should be sufficient for achieving the expected accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your model should be able to achieve 70% accuracy on the test set, with accuracy defined as the percentage of next tokens predicted correctly given the prefix. This is a token-level accuracy, not a sequence-level accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "After training your model, you should briefly discuss the training and achieved accuracy compared to your expectations. Print and analyze probabilities given by your model - what thing the model learn? How efficient is it?\n",
        "\n",
        "# Experiments (10% points)\n",
        "To complete this part of the homework assignment, you will need to test additional models with a different number of DecoderBlocks. Specifically, you should test and report accuracy for 0, 1, 2, 3, maybe 4 DecoderBlocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "After that, you should train models again with a variable number of blocks, but this time without positional encoding added to the embedding. You should observe that the model requires more layers to achieve the expected accuracy, but it is still able to do so.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Text generation (20% points)\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two methods for generating next token probabilities:\n",
        "* The inefficient method involves running the model with each prefix, predicting the next token, adding it to the prefix, and then running the whole model again. Note that this method may result in a 10% reduction in points.\n",
        "* The efficient method involves storing (caching) the K and V vectors used in the Attention layer, so that you can pass a single token to get the next one, instead of processing the whole prefix again.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, test and compare two sampling methods: argmax (taking, as the next token, the most likely token) and sampling from a distribution returned by the model. Generate a few sentences with those methods. How quickly a model can spot a pattern?\n",
        "\n",
        "[Alternatively, you can also implement temperature sampling, which allows you to smoothly interpolate between argmax, sampling from a given distribution, and sampling from a uniform distribution.]\n",
        "\n",
        "# Optional attention visualizations (0% points, but 100% cool)\n",
        "\n",
        "To better understand how the Transformer model is making its predictions, you can visualize the attention weights in different layers. This will allow you to see which tokens the model is actually paying attention to when making its predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "It may be helpful to compare the attention weights in a 1-layer Transformer to those in a 2-layer Transformer to understand why a 1-layer Transformer may not be able to do in-context learning while a 2-layer Transformer can. You can also refer to the following resource for a more in-depth analysis: https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/framework/index.html .\n",
        "\n",
        "# Tips and tricks\n",
        "* It is recommended that you read the original Transformer paper (\"Attention is All You Need\") at https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf, as well as the illustrated blog post on the Transformer at http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/ .\n",
        "* All models should train very quickly, especially if you are using a GPU accelerator on colab.research.google.com . Your model should be able to reach 70% accuracy in less than 3 minutes.\n",
        "* When implementing multi-head attention:\n",
        "  * It can be helpful to use torch.einsum. You can find examples in the numpy documentation at https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.einsum.html, specifically looking at \"Tensor contraction.\" This can help reduce the number of reshapes, permutations, and transpositions needed for matrix multiplications and make it easier to compute the attention matrix.\n",
        "  * Use the correct causal mask. Specifically, each \"token\" should only attend  to itself and previous tokens.\n",
        "* You can also consider implementing separate (parameterless) functions for split_heads and merge_heads that take a tensor and number of heads as input.\n",
        "* When implementing positional encoding, you can use \"sin\" on even dimensions and \"cos\" on odd dimensions, as described in the original paper. Alternatively, you can generate \"sin\" and \"cos\" separately and concatenate them. Both methods work equally well, and concatenation is generally easier to implement. You can refer to the \"Illustrated Transformer\" blog post for examples of both methods.\n",
        "* If you are having trouble with any part of the implementation, it can be helpful to check the output of each module separately and the output predictions of your model to identify any issues.\n",
        "* In the original Transformer paper, the LayerNorm layer is placed on the residual stream, after the Attention or FeedForward layer. However, it may be more effective to place the LayerNorm layer in front of the Attention or FeedForward layer, as this can help stabilize the training process and improve the model's performance. This approach has been used in some subsequent transformer-based models and has been found to be effective. It is possible that the placement of the LayerNorm layer in the original paper was simply a mistake and the code used actually placed the LayerNorm right before the FeedForward/Attention layers, where it should be.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Simplifications\n",
        "If you find certain parts of the task to be too difficult, you can try simplifying the task in one of the following ways. Keep in mind that your score may be reduced as a result, but this can help you proceed with the experiments and potentially identify any bugs in your code.\n",
        "\n",
        "* If you are having trouble training the model, you can try generating a dataset with fewer tokens and a smaller sequence length. This may make it easier to identify and fix any issues with your code or to tune the hyperparameters of the model.\n",
        "* If you are having difficulty implementing the positional encoding, you could try implementing learnable positional encoding. This involves adding an additional nn.Embedding layer that takes the position of the token (rather than the token itself) as input and returns an embedding for that particular position.\n",
        "* If you are struggling to implement the multi-head attention, you might try implementing just a single head attention without any splitting and concatenation. This can help you understand the method and make it easier to implement multi-head attention later.\n",
        "* When implementing Attention, it may be beneficial to skip the implementation of caching at first. You can train and evaluate the accuracy of the model without caching, and then add caching later to improve the efficiency of text generation (and your score)."
